Blend2D Experiments
-------------------

My personal experiments, nothing serious. The provided CMakeLists.txt expect `blend2d` in the root as `blend2d-experiments`.

  * bllitehtml
    * Implements a basic Blend2D backend for litehtml engine (implements litehtml::document_container), provides also a small demo application written in Qt.
    * There are some hardcoded paths to resources and URLs that you would have to adjust to make it display another page.
